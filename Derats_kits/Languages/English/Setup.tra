@1001 = ~Blood of Kossuth~
@1002 = ~Kossuth, the Lord of Flames, rarely takes physical form in the Forgotten Realms, but when this happens, his arrival always means mass destruction. He was summoned in 801 CV by a large gathering of worshippers who said they needed him to defend a coastal temple threatened by a monstrous octopus. Kossuth appeared in the middle of a terrifying blaze and fought the supernatural monster. The avatar overcame the octopus, but the latter managed to weaken the essence of Kossuth. The divine fire ran up along the body of the creature and took place in one of its eyes, instantly turning it into a weird black sphere lit from within by a permanent flame.
The sphere has been crimped in a silver pendant and is the catalyst for every believer who wishes to have some of the powers of Kossuth... if ready to pay the price.

//Items for the Sorcerer
@1003 = ~Great Robe of Ogi-Luke~
@1004 = ~This robe was made by a durable fabric, then dyed in midnight blue, the favorite color of its owner, the Archmage Ogi-Luke. Born in Sembia, Ogi-Luke was also a powerful and strong man by body and mind. But this was not enough; he wanted to have a colossal force. When he pulled on his robe, even the proudest fighters parted and boasters immediately silent as well. But the pride of Ogi-Luke was of no help against Nesk Whaltim, a Red Wizard who killed him and took his robe. Later, the cloth was stolen and sold by an audacious thief.

@1005 = ~Combat Robe of Sarat-Tapai~
@1006 = ~Sarat-Tapai of Cormyr was born strong in body and mind. Very young, he was chosen to integrate schools in dark arts, but this was not his deepest desire. He was diligent to learn arts and became an extremely powerful combat mage, but this did not satisfy him. In fact, he only wanted to mix with fighterse and to settle his issues by staff.
He worked many years in the design of the robe that would give him legitimacy.
The robe is woven by thin threads of iridium and powerfully enchanted. It gives its weaver all the attributes of the spell "Tenser's Transformation", without preventing him from casting spells. Only Sarat-Tapai could wear it during his lifetime, threads would narrow and clock neck if anyone else tries to put it on.
Today, no one can wear this robe, the locking system is still active operating for any mage attempting to wear the robe. But it is said that a mage resolutely turned towards fight as it was Sarat-Tapai could tame the item. That remains to be seen.

@10007 = ~Treaty over the strange careers~
@10008 = ~This big notebook deals with various people the author met, all having in common to follow an amazing career.
One of the pages talk about a wizard who had devoted his time to master stick handling, and that today would be almost equal to a fighter. A similar page speaks of another wizard who defeated a fighter in a fight with two daggers. Both would actually be called "Sorcerers".
Two pages about the middle of book speak of a fighter hungry for power, which is discovering an innate magic power, who partially diverted his fighter career to learn to control his new spells, thereby becoming a dervish of destruction. He would self-proclaim "Warlord".

A wizard character who wants to become Sorcerer and has at least 15 strength and dexterity and 1 skill point in the weapon proficiency that interests him can use this manual to become Sorcerer.
An exalted warrior character that just turned mage and whose script has not worked can use this book to become a warlord.~
